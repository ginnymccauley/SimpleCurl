# SimpleCurl
Project3 created for ginnymccauley 
I got half way through b level. I was able to code the target 
variable I was not able to get BFS to work I don't think 
I had trouble testing BFS because I could find 
out what to cout Also I tried to add find_url in BFS to fix 
my problems but it didn't work. I was reciving 
errors on a non-static member fuction without an object arguments.
I did not know how to fix this so I 
commented it out. I was able to get D level to work and it returned 
to me the document from the website that I gave it! YAY!!!!!
